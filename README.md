# Intelligent Registration System

This project is a modern, intelligent registration form with comprehensive validation and an automated testing suite using Selenium.

## Description

The Intelligent Registration System provides a user-friendly registration experience with real-time validation and dynamic form fields. It's designed to ensure data accuracy and a smooth user journey. The system includes a front-end interface and a robust set of automated tests to verify its functionality.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Location Dropdowns:** Country, state, and city dropdowns are dynamically populated and updated based on user selection.
-   **Real-time Validation:** The form provides instant feedback for various fields, including:
    -   Name, email, and phone number format.
    -   Password strength and confirmation.
    -   Required fields.
-   **Disposable Email Detection:** Prevents users from signing up with temporary or disposable email addresses.
-   **Country Code Synchronization:** The phone number's country code can be selected and is synchronized with the chosen country.
-   **Automated Testing:** Includes a suite of tests built with Selenium to automate and verify the form's functionality.

## File Descriptions

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the registration form.
-   `styles.css`: Contains all the styles for the registration form, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
-   `script.js`: The core JavaScript file that handles the form's logic, including validation, dynamic content, and event handling.
-   `data.js`: A data file containing information about countries, states, cities, disposable email domains, and other validation data.
-   `package.json`: Defines the project's metadata, dependencies (`selenium-webdriver`), and scripts for running the application and tests.
-   `selenium-test.js`: The automated testing script that uses Selenium to simulate user interactions and validate the form's behavior.
-   `test.html`: A simple HTML file, likely used for testing purposes.
-   `flow-a-error-state.png` & `flow-b-success-state.png`: Screenshots generated by the Selenium tests to capture the results of the test flows.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js and npm installed.
    *   Python (for the simple HTTP server).
    *   A web browser (e.g., Chrome) and the corresponding WebDriver for Selenium.

2.  **Installation:**
    *   Clone the repository.
    *   Navigate to the `RegistrationSystem` directory.
    *   Install the necessary Node.js packages:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Start the Application:**
    *   Run the following command to start a local server:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 5500
        ```
    *   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5500` (or the port specified by the server).

2.  **Fill out the form:**
    *   Complete the registration form with your details.
    *   The form will provide real-time feedback and validation.

## Testing

The project includes an automated test suite using Selenium to ensure the form's functionality.

1.  **Run the Tests:**
    *   Make sure the application is running correct path.
    *   In a separate terminal, run the test script:
        ```bash
        node test_file_name.js
        ```
   

2.  **Test Flows:**
    *   **Flow A (Negative Scenario):** Tests the form's behavior when a required field (e.g., Last Name) is left empty. It verifies that an error message is displayed correctly.
    *   **Flow B (Positive Scenario):** Tests a successful registration by filling out all fields with valid data. It confirms that a success message is shown.
    *   **Flow C (Form Logic Validation):** Verifies various form logic, such as the dynamic behavior of dropdowns, password strength meter, and other validation rules without completing a full submission.
